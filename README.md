# ICE
Lightweight opensource login controller for windows 

## Introduction

ICE is a simple utility built on C that allows users to set a login-duration for a computer everyday. It is an application aimed at parents who wish to control their children's computer usage habits. While several _safe browsing_ products existed and, continue to mushroom as we speak, the developers felt a noticable gap in availability of tools to control the actual usage of the device itself. In 2017, this feature exists for most smartphones and tablets; In 2013, the case was quite different. The developers took it upon themselves to develop this project based on that very idea.

[Visit the project website][1] for source code, downloads and more.

## Usage

ICE is available as a downloadable script that will build and make itself available on the target computer. Follow the onscreen instructions after downloading the application.

ICE is also available as a standalone project with all the source code. Anyone is able to use and/or modify these resources under the MIT License.
